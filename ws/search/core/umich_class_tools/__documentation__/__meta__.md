## Umich Class Tools

These commands are specifically helpful for students taking classes at the
University of Michigan.

Most of these commands accept a class name/number as an optional parameter.
(For instance, `eecs 280`, or `engr101`.) The documentation for each command
includes a list of supported classes.
